# 📚 Custom Doubly Linked List in C++

This project is a custom implementation of a **doubly linked list** in **C++**, designed using object-oriented programming (OOP) and templates to support any data type.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Insert at beginning, end, or after a specific node
- Delete first, last, or specific node
- Access elements by index
- Update values
- Reverse the list
- Print the list
- Clear the list
- Check list size and if it's empty

## 🛠 How to Use

```cpp
#include "clsDblLinkedList.h"

int main() {
    clsDblLinkedList<int> list;
    list.InsertAtBeginning(1);
    list.InsertAtEnd(5);
    list.PrintList(); // Output: 1 5
    return 0;
}
````
